History.js library
==================

This is a simple PHP Composer package that will install History.js in your Composer project.
It will also create a "Mouf" instance for that plugin (if you are using Mouf). The version imported in Mouf by default is the jQuery history version.

More about this library on its homepage: https://github.com/browserstate/history.js

Included version in this repository: History.js 1.8b2.
